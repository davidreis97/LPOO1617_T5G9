## TODO
* [ ] - Improve code to at least 7 / 10 on bettercodehub <---- Refactor GUI / More tests (also helps vv)
* [ ] - Check coverage of unit testing and mutations in dkeep.logic (at least 80% and at least 60% respectively)
* [ ] - Generate HTML documentation
* [ ] - Level editor - user can specify width/height of Keep map (current implementation forces square maps)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [ ] - CLI Save/Load
* [ ] - dkeep.logic Javadoc documentation
* [ ] - Random coords for Ogres
* [ ] - Try to remove changeMap from Game.java (not open-closed design)

EXTRAS
