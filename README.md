[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/davidreis97/LPOO1617_T5G9)](https://bettercodehub.com/)


## TODO
* [ ] - Improve code to at least 7/10 on bettercodehub
* [x] - Add missing sprites (hero with weapon, guard sleeping, maybe more...)
* [ ] - Check coverage of unit testing and mutations in dkeep.game (at least 80% and at least 60% respectively)
* [ ] - Multiple Ogres (Ogres can overlap, Clubs can't)
* [ ] - Entity collision (Hero can't move into Ogre, Club spawning inside Hero is loss)
* [ ] - Javadoc documentation
* [ ] - Generate HTML documentation
