[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/davidreis97/LPOO1617_T5G9?token=4c896aa8e6f8e7d1f536652d1daba905df0a5acc)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

## TODO
* [ ] - Improve code to at least 7 / 10 on bettercodehub <---- Refactor GUI?
* [ ] - Check coverage of unit testing and mutations in dkeep.logic (at least 80% and at least 60% respectively)
* [ ] - Generate HTML documentation
* [x] - Check TODO Auto-generated method stub in SimpleGraphicsPanel.java (unused functions?)
* [ ] - Level editor - user can specify width/height of Keep map (current implementation forces square maps)
* [x] - "Allow the user to save/load a game state into/from a file. Explore the Java I/O API, specially the Serialization part" 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [ ] - dkeep.logic Javadoc documentation
* [ ] - Random coords for Ogres
* [ ] - Partition CLI.java so BCH doesn't complain
* [ ] - Try to remove changeMap from Game.java (not open-closed design)
* [ ] - Unit testing - modify updateGame to freeze Hero movement when needed

EXTRAS
* [ ] - Replace Game states with enums
* [ ] - Console play by play
* [ ] - Level editor - non-square maps
